# Flight-Price-Prediction
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict flight ticket prices based on a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains various features like airline, source, destination, date of journey, duration, and more, which are used to build models that can estimate flight prices with accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle's Flight Price Prediction dataset. It contains information about airline, source, destination, route, duration, and several other features related to flights.

## Target:
Price of the flight ticket

## Models
The project explores the following machine learning models:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor

Each model is evaluated using performance metrics such as:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared score
